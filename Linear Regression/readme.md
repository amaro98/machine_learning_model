<H1><b> Cancer Cell Prediction Using Logistic Regression</b> </h1>

<h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
<b>Aim: To distinguish the tumor detected into beingn or malignant based on several inputs< using Logistic Regression<br>
  
  <h2><b>How Logistic Regression Works?</b></h2>
  <p>
  - Logistic Regression is commonly used in Classification problems where the dependent variables (or in other words, the output that we want to predict) is a binary output</br>
  - It has a bit of similarity with <u>Linear Regreession</u> where it estimates the parameter of the predictive equation based on the given data</br>
  - The only difference is, since we deal with classification the output of the logisitc regression always lies between 0 <b>and</b> 1 </br>
  - The parameters are adjusted to ensure the line can fit as much point/as near as possible
